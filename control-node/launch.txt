ROS2 Environment Setup and Node Execution Guide for control-node

1. Activating the Environment
	To activate the ROS2 environment, follow these steps:

	source ros2_dashing_py36/bin/activate
	source ros2/dashing/setup.bash



2. Running the Serial Control Node
	Option 1: Running in Foreground with Interaction
	To run the serial_control_node.py interactively:

		python serial_control_node.py

	Option 2: Running in Background
	To run the serial_control_node.py in the background:

		nohup python serial_control_node.py &

	Press Enter to regain control of the terminal.



3. Verifying the Serial Control Node is Running
	To check if the serial_control_node.py is running:

		ps aux | grep serial_control_node.py



4. Running the Flask Control Node
	Option 1: Running in Foreground with Interaction
	To run the flask_control_node.py interactively:

		python flask_control_node.py

	Option 2: Running in Background
	To run the flask_control_node.py in the background:

		nohup python flask_control_node.py &

	Press Enter to regain control of the terminal.



5. Verifying the Flask Control Node is Running
	To check if the flask_control_node.py is running:

		ps aux | grep flask_control_node.py



6. Checking Command History
	To view the command history and outputs of background tasks:

		cat nohup.out



7. Troubleshooting: Serial Port Errors
	If you encounter the following error:
	"could not open port /dev/ttyACM1: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/dev/ttyACM1'"
	Use the following command to list available serial ports:

		ls /dev/tty*

	Identify the correct serial port and update the serial_control_node.py script with the correct port.



8. Killing Background Processes
	If you want to kill a background process, use the following command:

		kill [PID]

	Replace [PID] with the process ID of the running background task.


Document Usage
- Save this document for reference when setting up or troubleshooting ROS2 nodes.
- Use the commands provided to activate the environment, run nodes, and verify operations.
- Ensure you have the correct serial port configured to avoid connectivity issues.
